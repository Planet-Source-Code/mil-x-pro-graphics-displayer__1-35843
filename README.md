### Description

This is a common window's picture file formats viewer using streatchblt. It have zoomin/out, stretch, exact size and built-in slide. Also simple file management such as copy, rename and delete. Actually I wrote this project in attempt to compare the advantage of Stretchblt vs paintpicture and I thought it maybe useful to you. Feedback, comment, critics, idea are welcome.
